    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    <p>
The Math Competition Club at PMSS is a club meant to provide opportunities for students interested in math to compete and improve their skills. It hosts a
variety of well-recognized math contests from Canada and the USA, as well as activities such as a Problem of the Week. The in-person meetings aim to help students prepare
for upcoming math contests through problem sets and discussions.<br><br>

Most club activities are supplemented by a Teams page, where meeting reminders and contest announcements are posted, as well as facilitating
club interactions such as answer submissions for the Problem of the Week. Club members are also welcome to ask questions or provide suggestions.
    </p><br>
    <p><b>Meetings</b></p>
    <p>
The club meetings will usually take place on the first two Thursdays of a month, at lunch. However, this could be subject to change as more
club activities are added. Most math contests are run after school, starting at 3:30 PM.
